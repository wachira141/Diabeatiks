# Diabeatiks
<p>Diabeatiks is a program that tries to link diabetes patients to all parties involved. it will try
to narrow down the process of finding information and centralize all the needs of a patient to a single site.
Patients will be able to share information with others which include displaying their prescriptions, how they feel about the prescription, physical excercises, meal plans, make appointments and eventually plan for a community hangout. they will also be able to request for reviews about their physical execercise, diet and prescription from the party with the proffessional knowledge on the field required</p>

<b>This README will provide more details about the site</b>
